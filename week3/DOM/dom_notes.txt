Node Types:

Common types of nodes include:
Element nodes: Represent HTML elements.
Attribute nodes: Represent attributes of elements.
Text nodes: Represent text content within elements.
Accessing Elements:

JavaScript can be used to access and manipulate the DOM. Common methods include:
getElementById(): Gets an element by its ID.
getElementsByClassName(): Gets elements by their class name.
getElementsByTagName(): Gets elements by their tag name.
querySelector() and querySelectorAll(): Select elements using CSS selectors.
Manipulating Elements:

JavaScript allows the manipulation of elements in the DOM:
Changing content: innerHTML, textContent.
Modifying attributes: setAttribute(), getAttribute().
Adding or removing classes: classList.add(), classList.remove().
Event Handling:

DOM events, such as click, submit, or keypress, can be handled using JavaScript:
addEventListener(): Attaches an event listener to an element.
removeEventListener(): Removes an event listener.
Traversing the DOM:

DOM traversal involves moving between different nodes in the tree:
Parent, child, and sibling relationships can be navigated using properties like parentNode, childNodes, firstChild, lastChild, nextSibling, and previousSibling.
Creating and Appending Elements:

New elements can be created using document.createElement(), and they can be appended to the DOM using appendChild().
Modifying Styles:

Styles of elements can be modified using the style property:
element.style.property = value.
Document Object:

The document object represents the entire HTML document and provides methods and properties for interacting with the document.
Browser Compatibility:

The DOM is supported by modern browsers, and JavaScript is the language commonly used to interact with it. However, browser-specific considerations may exist.
Understanding the DOM is crucial for client-side web development as it enables dynamic manipulation and interaction with HTML documents through JavaScript.
